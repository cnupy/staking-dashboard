/**
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * This utility analyzes the relationship between Stake transactions and their corresponding
 * Deposit/FailedDeposit events to determine the status and failure reason of each stake.
 *
 * PROBLEM:
 * When users stake and sequencer enter queue, rollup then would flush the queue that triggers either:
 * - A Deposit event (successful sequencer registration)
 * - A FailedDeposit event (rejected sequencer)
 *
 * However, the smart contract doesn't explicitly tell us WHY a deposit failed and which Stakes a FailedDeposit event belong to.
 * We need to infer that by analyzing the chronological history of events.
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 * 1. Build a timeline of ALL events (Deposit + FailedDeposit) per attester-withdrawer pair
 * 2. Track "active state" - whether a pair has successfully deposited before
 * 3. Infer failure reason based on state:
 *    - INVALID_KEY: Failed before any successful deposit (bad validator key)
 *    - DUPLICATE: Failed after a successful deposit (key already registered)
 * 4. Match events to stakes using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) chronological order
 *
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * - Timeline: Events sorted by blockNumber then logIndex for deterministic ordering
 * - Active State: Tracks if an attester-withdrawer pair has ever succeeded
 * - FIFO Matching: Each stake consumes the first eligible event after it
 * - Event Consumption: Once matched, an event (FailedDeposit / Deposit) cannot be reused for another stake
 *
 * EXAMPLE FLOW:
 * Stake(100) -> FailedDeposit(105) -> Stake(200) -> Deposit(205)
 * Result:
 * - Stake(100): FAILED with INVALID_KEY reason (no prior success)
 * - Stake(200): SUCCESS (matched with Deposit at 205)
 *
 * FUTURE: When unstaking is implemented, reset active state on unstake events.
