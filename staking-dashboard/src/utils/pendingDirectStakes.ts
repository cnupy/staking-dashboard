/**
 * Utility for managing pending ERC20 direct stakes in localStorage.
 *
 * ERC20 direct stakes (via Rollup.deposit()) don't appear in the API until
 * the validator queue is flushed. This utility allows tracking pending stakes
 * locally so users can see them in the UI immediately after staking.
 *
 * ## Why localStorage instead of a new database table?
 *
 * We considered adding a `ValidatorQueued` event handler to the indexer to track
 * stakes immediately when they enter the queue. However, this approach had issues:
 *
 * 1. **Race conditions**: The `ValidatorQueued` event fires for ALL deposits
 *    (ATP, ERC20-with-provider, ERC20-direct). Detecting which ones are "ERC20 direct"
 *    requires checking if records exist in other tables, but event ordering within
 *    the same transaction could cause false positives.
 *
 * 2. **Schema complexity**: Would require a new `erc20DirectStake` table and careful
 *    deduplication logic to avoid double-counting stakes that also appear in the
 *    `deposit` table after activation.
 *
 * 3. **Production risk**: Backend changes require more testing and carry higher risk
 *    for a production system.
 *
 * The localStorage approach is simpler, safer, and provides the same UX benefit:
 * users see their stake immediately after the transaction completes.
